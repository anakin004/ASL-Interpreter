- collect keypoints using mediapipe holistic

- train model

- predict 


work flow:

1. install dependencies
2. keypoints
3. extract those key points
4. setup folders for collection
5. collect keypoint values for train and test
6. preprocess data and create labels and features
7. build and train neutral net 
8. predict 
9. save weights
10. evaluate using confusion matrix and accuracy
11. test in real time
